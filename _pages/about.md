Hi! I'm Sthefanie, it's a pleasure to meet you.

All my life I dreamed of being a **scientist**, but not necessarily inside big chemistry labs but in labs with several computers researching and running code that I had made myself.

Fortunately I am building this dream little by little and during my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering I had the pleasure of doing research in a laboratory (LICON - UTFPR/PG) and discovering my passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

These years of research at the university helped me a lot to build the knowledge I have today and with the help of my professor we published several articles.

I am currently graduated and work researching, doing projects applied to machine learning, and finally teaching these projects to Alura students.

I decided that in 2022 I would build my portfolio on GitHub, in addition to bringing more content to the community in a more accessible way.
For 2023, I hope to join an applied master's degree in computer vision in order to learn better about the techniques I already know and learn about new ways of analyzing images and videos.

What will you find here?
======
This is an academic page, where I will publish all my life related to research and works. So the sections are separated in the header of the page, so that it is easier to understand the content of each tab. If you want to know what publications I made, just go to the [Publications](https://sthemonica.github.io/publications/) tab. To see the projects I'm developing on GitHub, in a more organized and visual way, you can go to the [Portfolio](https://sthemonica.github.io/portfolio/) tab. If you want to see my complete CV, from my education to my technical skills, internships and other information, go to the [CV](https://sthemonica.github.io/cv/) tab.

**WARNING:** These pages are still being built, so some information may be missing. If you want to ask something specific, you can contact me through any of the means you prefer, such as Email, Instagram or LinkedIn. These information are in the sidebar.



Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
