Hi! I'm Sthefanie, it's a pleasure to meet you.

All my life I dreamed of being a **scientist**, but not necessarily inside big chemistry labs but in labs with several computers researching and running code that I had made myself.

Fortunately I am building this dream little by little and during my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering I had the pleasure of doing research in a laboratory (LICON - UTFPR/PG) and discovering my passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

These years of research at the university helped me a lot to build the knowledge I have today and with the help of my professor we published several articles.

I am currently graduated and work researching, doing projects applied to machine learning, and finally teaching these projects to Alura students.

I decided that in 2022 I would build my portfolio on GitHub, in addition to bringing more content to the community in a more accessible way.
For 2023, I hope to join an applied master's degree in computer vision in order to learn better about the techniques I already know and learn about new ways of analyzing images and videos.

What will you find here?
======
This is an academic page, where I will publish all my life related to research and works. So the sections are separated in the header of the page, so that it is easier to understand the content of each tab. If you want to know what publications I made, just go to the [Publications](https://sthemonica.github.io/publications/) tab. To see the projects I'm developing on GitHub, in a more organized and visual way, you can go to the [Portfolio](https://sthemonica.github.io/portfolio/) tab. If you want to see my complete CV, from my education to my technical skills, internships and other information, go to the [CV](https://sthemonica.github.io/cv/) tab.

**WARNING:** These pages are still being built, so some information may be missing. If you want to ask something specific, you can contact me through any of the means you prefer, such as Email, Instagram or LinkedIn. These information are in the sidebar.



Contents I produce
======
Since I decided to become a scientist, I decided that I would like to share my work and make it easier for other people to understand the world of technology. From small events where I could share knowledge with my friends to the creation of courses at work, I feel very happy to be able to bring more and more about something I love. Still in 2022, my goal is to have a YouTube channel to teach Machine Learning and Computer Vision in Portuguese in an uncomplicated way, my goal is that by the end of the year the channel will have more than 5000 subscribers. 

Aside from video content, one of my passions is reading articles and I sincerely love writing. So, one of the platforms that I intend to start in 2022 is writing for Medium, I see a great potential to share information there and a very large reach when combined with other forms of dissemination, such as LinkedIn.


Programming languages
------
During graduation, I had contact with several programming languages, **Java, JavaScript, C, C++, MATLAB** and the one I use the most nowadays, which is **Python**. As I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, I have knowledge of programming for microcontrollers as well, in addition to the area of ​​artificial intelligence, and the other programming languages ​​I learned because of subjects I needed to do or just out of curiosity.
